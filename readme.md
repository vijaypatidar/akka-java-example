# AKKA 
Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building: 
* Highly concurrent
* Scalable
* Distributed
* Fault tolerant
* Event driven

Akka allows us to focus on meeting business needs instead of writing low-level code to provide reliable behavior, fault tolerance, and high performance.

## Akka Actor
Actors are the unit of execution in Akka. The Actor model is an abstraction that makes it easier to write correct concurrent, parallel and distributed systems.To help us deal with these realities, Akka provides:

* Multi-threaded behavior without the use of low-level concurrency constructs like atomics or locks.
* Transparent remote communication between systems and their components.
* A clustered, high-availability architecture that is elastic, scales in or out, on demand.
